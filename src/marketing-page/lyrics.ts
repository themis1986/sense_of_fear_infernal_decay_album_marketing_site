  2: `Legend has it the war is near
Humankind at its end
Hades awaits for the mortal tears
Perennial doom to attend

It was always a beast within
Waiting, holding the door
No one enters or leaves at all
Behold, Guardian of Hell

And they came down with blood in their hands
Αnd the sun became red on their heads
It was eternal damnation for them
Cerberus rising

Fires spawned from his threefold head
Snakes coiling his snouts
People roaming, they screamed and fled
I can still hear the shouts

In the abyss where anguish lies
There he feeds on their cries
Eyes aflame and a heart like coal
He guards the gate to your soul
`,
  3: `As I walk through the valley of life
I see no unity, only strife
People are hurting all over again
No lessons learned in the end

There are those who’re exploiting our fears
Killing for profit, endless years
Hacking and slashing as long as they need
No consequences at all

Every hope looks like resting in peace
Masses are lying, all deceased
No moral compass is pointing the north
Forfeited consciences weep

And there’s you who is drowning in ache
No true redemption, all is fake
Feels like you’re reaching the edge of the world
Stare at the abyss beyond

Purge my pain as we drain
Walk with me through the darkness
Fight with me, dream with me
Stand by me till the end

In the realm of despair I plead
Unity falters, colors bleed
Suffering echoes in the hearts of men
No wisdom gained, we descend

In the shadows where torment resides
A mind in turmoil, sanity hides
In the night where emotions are grown
Lost in the depths of my own
`,
  4: `Alongside the river
Following the flow
Progression of captivity
Beginning of the fall
Never forget

The road to greatness
Fire, death and pain
Committed to the madness
A lot of filth to gain

The structure of corruption
The rubbish of your world
Summon your devastation
Few left to hold

Still the same, death from life we have chosen
All in pain, gold’s what matters the most
Propaganda mesmerized where we stand
Interests conflict through fire and sand

Creating sick societies
Abnormal way to live
Breathing smoke and fire
Ashes covered the dream

The trust to your deceivers
Made you feel what’s coming next
We must stand against this darkness
We must learn to live again
`,
  6: `Through smoke and ash, a tale unwinds
Since the dawn of time
Warfare attracted mankind
In the heart of conflict, we built our prime
We left all our values behind

Bound by destiny, fight and conquer
In the name of love we always wonder
An endless battle, forever in our minds
A bloody romance

Armored titans clash and roar
Cracking the earth at its very core
Amidst the chaos, a deadly score
Stories of glory (forever) untold

Kiss of war, embrace the flame
Blood and thunder, a land to claim
Kiss of war, the battlefield roars
A sky asunder, we settle our scores

The drums of war, they pound the earth
As chaos reigns, it’s giving birth
To a dance of steel, a deadly waltz
Where destiny's sealed in bloody vaults

In a call of fate, we claim our prize
In the name of love our hearts shall rise
A ceaseless war eternally we find
A fiery dance`,
  7: `Days of your past, your actions will last
Searching for glory, your number one task
Live is to die and die is to live
A legend soon you will become

That’s what the ancients were trying to achieve
Dying in battle, an oath to fulfill
Songs and hymns will be written for you
A quest for eternal life

Earn your way to the top
Glory forever through time
The world will remember your name
Fight till death and live

Now we are living in the kingdom of disgrace
Maybe it’s time your faith to embrace
World’s an arena with warriors and beasts
Claim your rightful fame

Your will to go far, your need to succeed
Your courage to try yourself to redeem
From father to son, you’re passing the torch
The light for all generations`,
  8: `
  In the darkest corners of your mind
A tangled maze where demons grind
Through the shadows we dare to tread
In the labyrinth inside your head

A twisted realm where fears entwine
In the labyrinth of my soul's design
Screams echo in the halls of dead
In the labyrinth inside your head

Fall in the labyrinth inside your head
Tormented me again
Lost in a dreamless sleep, we meet again
Fighting yet in vain

Haunted whispers, voices cold
In this twisted place our lives unfold
The walls close in, the path ahead
In the labyrinth inside your head

With every step the darkness looms
In an eternal night we are consumed
But we'll press on, we won't relent
In the labyrinth our souls are spent`,
  9: `
  I was born from light
I am your shapeless form
I am able to fly for you
I am your loyal friend
Nothing can ever touch me

From dust till dawn
Your dark side from below
With no flesh or bones
I am not alive but I still grow

Riddle of shadows
Riddle of pain
No door, no key to turn
Riddle of shadows
A walk in the rain

Riddle of shadows
Riddle of pain
No floor, not free to run
Riddle of shadows
A scream but in vain

Cannot see, cannot hear, cannot feel
Cannot have a soul
A silent limbo
As the light ends
I wait my turn in silence

I am the darkest trace
Where light cannot embrace space
I have no disguise, I hear your lies
I’m connected to you
I am you

From the dawn of time, I was there
I witnessed things you aren’t even aware
I’m cast from light
but when the night falls I’m often feared
But I am not your demon side

Am I a prisoner
Who can’t be released?
Am I the unknown?
Or am I just your clone?`,
  10: `After an infernal decay of your soul
Your shallow journey finally came to an end

Life is a circle
Full of years to unfold
But who knows the ending
Neither young nor the old

An absence of feelings
A sense of decay
A mortal reminder
Only inches away

Every action you‘ll make
Every word you will say
Every promise you‘ll break
At the end you will have to pay

A life in front of a wall
Behind you a burning fire
Staring only at shadows
A cave of truth and lies

Go on this journey alone
On this path on your own
In the void of your thoughts
In your mind and your soul

Walk all this passage alone
On this road to unknown
Where you dwell seeking light
Through the dark and the fog

The voices in your head
Of hate and aggression
Keep asking me a question
With a billion answers to give

No dream for a better tomorrow
A circle in my thoughts
Trying hard not to waste
A perfect today away

The path to rise above
Through doubt and hesitation
The path to reach your goals
Only through determination

Eternal decay
Of infernal damnation
Clearing your thoughts
Not to go astray

Infernal, eternal
Salvation, damnation
Our roads meet to nowhere
Our turmoil, we suffer

It’s time to see the light
Beyond the realm of mind
Beyond the mortal borders
It’s time to see the wonders

The shallow journey of your soul
The burden of life takes its toll

We are the drops of light
Into the cosmic night`,
  11: `Think your revenge
Reach to the edge
Darkness filled my mind
My body collapsed

You must prepare
My mercy now ends
Reveal my dark side
You cannot survive

See my eyes are burning for vengeance
My will is now to see you desperate
Hate and fire my soul have taken
It's time for me to retaliate

Wounds never healed
My wrath's melting steel
You brought your betrayal
I got nothing to feel

Death and demise
Hell now arise
My own salvation
I can't compromise`,
